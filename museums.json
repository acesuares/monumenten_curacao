Christiaan J.H. Engels and his father-in-law Rudolph Boskaljon. The museum\u2019s goal was to show the visitors a view of the past and at the same time exhibit contemporary local and international art. It was the first and for a long time the only museum on the island. Eventually many of the museumgoals were taken over by other museums on Cura\u00e7ao and the other islands of the former Dutch Antilles. Nowadays the museum focuses on the Western influences on the Curacaoan culture, especially in the visual arts, which confirms her pluriform and multicultural background. The museum is housed in a former military hospital for yellow fever patients, built in 1853 by the Dutch Military.The collection on display exists of paintings, etches, drawings, statues, furniture, glass and textile, made by national as well as international artists. In the museum two period rooms, a living room and a bedroom, are furnished with mainly 19th century mahogany wooden furniture. There is also a traditional Curacaon kitchen. In the West-Indie Zaal you can see the map of the Caribbean made of \u201cstained glass\u201d by W. Bogtman. It was made especially for the World Exhibition in New York in 1939.

From a very early age, Mr. Maduro had been a fervent collector of documents, books, manuscripts, archivalia and periodicals relating to Cura\u00e7ao and the Dutch West Indies. These ranged from publications of major historical significance such as paper clippings and photos of Lindbergh's visit to Cura\u00e7ao, to the mundane: calendars and invitation cards, menus and other day-to-day items which provide insight into everyday life. The collection is carefully complemented with postcards, phonograph records, stamps, bank notes and coins. Naturally, documentation on the history of the Jewish community in Cura\u00e7ao also forms a major section of the library. Some unique publications which are found in this collection include a comprehensive and chronical description of the Urbina invasion of 1929. The Jewish roots of the local community are firmly captured in the pristine \"Memorias Senior\" (c.a. 1750) and \"Memorias Curiel\" (c.a. 1730). Finally one of the earliest documents \"exposing\" the indigenous \"papiamentu\" language can be found in the form of \"Il dialetto Curassese\" by Teza (1863). The Mongui Maduro Collection is situated in no ordinary library. Rather this remarkable collection is housed in antique cabinets, admidst a household setting that appears to have changed little since the heyday of the plantation houses. An antique dresser with a mirror and a complete set of bedroom furniture are but a few of the items which tastefully decorate the valuable documents in a complete room-setting. Precious, large mahogany cabinets and even an immaculate antique 19th century \"fontein\" (or wall-fountain) carefully complement the main room. While the original collection of Mongui Maduro forms the basis of the library, new publications on the Antilles are constantly being acquired so that it will continue to be an authoritative source on the evolution of political, social and cultural history of the Netherlands Antilles and Cura\u00e7ao in particular. One room has been set aside to honor the memory of Mongui's widow, Louise. It primarily contains her collection of the sea-shells and numerous handicraft objects.
